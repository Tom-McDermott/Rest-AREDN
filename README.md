Python3 program to poll a list of AREDN nodes using REST and JSON.
Then print out a somewhat-formatted text document with the 
node status and link-info.

The Python file has a list of nodes that can be edited, the output
filename is hard-coded in the file.  It's a linux filespec in this
code, but can be easily changed to windows style filespec (should
be obvious how to do).
